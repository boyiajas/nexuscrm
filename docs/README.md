# NexusCRM Documentation

This folder collects the working notes you asked for so anyone can understand the system quickly. Files are grouped by scope:

- [Architecture](architecture.md) – stack, deployment shape, and cross-cutting flows.
- [System Flows](system-flows.md) – end-to-end paths (login, campaigns, chat, audit).
- Backend – [overview](backend/README.md), [routes](backend/routes.md), [data models](backend/data-models.md), [services](backend/services.md).
- Frontend – [overview](frontend/README.md) and [page map](frontend/views.md).
- Cross-cutting – [authorization](backend/authorization.md).
- Features (combined frontend + backend for each domain): see `docs/features/*.md`.
